# The microbiome diversifies N-acyl lipid pools - including short-chain fatty acid-derived compounds

## Figures
This folder contains the scripts used to generate all the figures and supplementary figures in the manuscript "The microbiome diversifies N-acyl lipid pools - including short-chain fatty acid-derived compounds", in addition to the input tables files and source data for each of them. For files that are 'missing'due to the limit size in GitHub (25MB), please check the following link (XXX).

## Data_processing_MZmine
This folder have all the MZmine batch files used to pre-process all the metabolomics data discussed in this manuscript. All the output files (quant table, CSV; MS/MS spectra, MGF) are also available. For files that are 'missing'due to the limit size in GitHub (25MB), please check the following link (XXX).

## FASST_filters
Scripts used to filter the FASST searches to get cosine values above 0.7 with raw MS/MS spectra (unfiltered spectra).

## Supplementary Tables
Excel sheets with all the supplementary tables discussed in the manuscript.

## GNPS-N-ACYL-LIPIDS-MASSQL.mgf
N-acyl lipids library created. This library consists of 3,063 MS/MS spectra of highest intensity from from the clustered spectra of public data on GNPS/MassIVE recovered using MassQL queries designed for N-acyl lipids. This library contains MS/MS spectra of 851 unique N-acyl lipids (46 different headgroups and fatty acid chain length ranging from 2 to 30 carbons and up to 4 unsaturations). Note: This library is available in the GNPS environment through the following link: https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/gnpslibrary.jsp?library=GNPS-N-ACYL-LIPIDS-MASSQL
